# CTet

Just a basic stacker game (my specialty LOL) to help me learn C.
Using SDL2 because I'm not in the mood for Win32 + DirectX/Vulkan right now.

# Build
Currently only built for Windows using MSVC.
Looking into testing Linux soon.
I don't have a Mac to test, I apologize.

Everything should compile and link itself. Make sure you get all the git submodules checked out.

Just build with CMake as you normally do (`cmake -Bbuild` in the root dir and then `cmake --build build`).

If you want to use Visual Studio, refer to [this guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/cmake-projects-in-visual-studio)
